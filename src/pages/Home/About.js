                    <p className="py-6">We provide tools for travel professionals to create experiences their customers love. The Cute Cut Hair Studio is centrally located and a short walk from many of the area’s most popular hotels and visitor hot spots. With the narrow historic roads of the French Quarter, walking is usually not only the quickest route but certainly has the least impact on our environment.</p>
